2. competitive_agent — Competitive Landscape: Competitor identification, feature comparison, funding signals, market share.
3. win_loss_agent — Win/Loss Intelligence: Review sentiment, buyer objections, churn signals, user feedback from forums/communities.
4. pricing_agent — Pricing & Packaging: Pricing model analysis, tier comparison, willingness-to-pay signals.
5. positioning_agent — Positioning & Messaging: How competitors talk about themselves vs. how users perceive them, ad messaging.
6. adjacent_market_agent — Adjacent Market Collision: Threats from outside the core category, convergence signals.

For each agent, write a specific research task tailored to the user's query. All 6 agents MUST be included in your response — no exceptions.
